# Disquiet Dog: GV English: key page redesign

This project embraces selected pages which [GV English](https://gvenglish.com/) have requested a new design for.

All are conceived as working within the constraints of GV Englishâ€™s existing WordPress theme called `educationpack`, hence the reference to `wpedpack` in this repo name.

Pages currently under consideration: 

- [Homepage](https://disquietdog.github.io/gvenglish-wpedpack/)
- [English for Academic Purposes (EAP)](https://disquietdog.github.io/gvenglish-wpedpack/programs/english-for-academic-pathways/)
    - [v2](https://disquietdog.github.io/gvenglish-wpedpack/programs/english-for-academic-pathways/)
